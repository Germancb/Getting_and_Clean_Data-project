This es code book for the course: Getting and Cleaning Data Project (assignment week4)
The raw data for tthis project came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data comes from the website and was collected from the
accelerometres from the Samsung Galaxy S smarthphones. A full description is vailable at this site:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The experiments were been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers that used a samsung Smartphones. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
The raw dataset included the following files:
1) ‘README.txt’
2) "features_info.txt": Variables used on the feature vector.
3) "features.txt": List of all features.
4) "activity_labels.txt": Class labels with their activity name.
5)	"train/X_train.txt": Training set.
6) "train/y_train.txt": Training labels
7) "train/subject_train.txt" Subject who performed the activity
8) "test/X_test.txt": Test set.
9) "test/subject_test.txt"
10)	"test/y_test.txt": Test labels.
The attached script (README.md) does the following:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
